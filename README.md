# Ice Skating Sequence Generator
Too lonely to play add-ons with friends? Allow this small web-app to help!

With this web-app you can generate a sequence of compatible ice skating moves to practice with.

## Compatible moves?
Two given moves are compatible if the exit edge of the first move is the same as the entry edge of the second.

For example:

- Left outside three-turn -> Salchow
- Salchow -> Axel
- Axel -> Forward scratch spin.

This also demonstrates one of the downfalls of automatically generated sequences. Landing an axel and then 
stepping straight into a forward scratch spin would be very difficult, but it is technically possible :)
